    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with persistent sidebar navigation for top-level categories (Regions, Characters, Tech, Themes). The main content area dynamically updates based on user selection. This non-linear, hub-and-spoke model was chosen to allow users to freely explore the complex, interconnected world of the novel at their own pace, prioritizing discovery over a linear narrative path. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Regional populations -> Goal: Compare -> Viz/Presentation: Simple bar chart using styled HTML/CSS -> Interaction: Visual comparison at a glance -> Justification: More lightweight and stylistically integrated than a full charting library for simple proportional data. Report Info: Character details -> Goal: Inform -> Presentation: Interactive modal/overlay -> Interaction: Click-to-reveal -> Justification: Keeps the main UI clean while providing deep-dive information on demand. All interactions are handled with vanilla JS for performance and simplicity. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
